# Projects
This repository is intended to store all of my previous and ongoing projects. The main software that I use is python.
My first code project was an unguided project by DataCamp - Data Analysis with Python on The Office Data. 
My second code project was an assignment to do Toucan Crosswalk Simulation using Blinkstick.
